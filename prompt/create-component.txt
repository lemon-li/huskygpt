Here is a simple example of how to write a "Component":
1. If the component render is simple, you can write it in one function component.
export const Component = (props: IProps) => {
  {Your render chunks or react hooks here}
  return (
    {Your main render code here}
  );
};

2. If the component render is complex, you can write it in a class component.
export class Component extends React.Component {
  {Your render chunks here}

  public render() {
    {Your main render code here}
    {Read data from store}
  }
}
